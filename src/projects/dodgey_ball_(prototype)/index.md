## what's this?

My intention was to make a fun fast-paced multiplayer game, akin to [Sports Heads](https://www.mousebreaker.com/game/sports-heads-football-championship) and games of that ilk. Except it's based on dodgeball rules, and played in 3D space.

Designed for controllers.

It got as far as it did, then life happened. I hope to revitalise the idea with [dodgeball](/blog/tags/dodgeball).
