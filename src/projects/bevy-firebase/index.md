## what's this?

I need to be able to interface with firebase for my [upcoming dodgeball game](/blog/tags/dodgeball), so I'm building a plugin to help. Might be two plugins, it's early doors yet.

The plugin will abstract away Firebase auth and provide methods for interacting with Firestore as an end user, no need for service accounts. 

Browser based oAuth2 login flow.

FOSS
