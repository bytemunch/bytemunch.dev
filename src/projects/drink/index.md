## what's this?

a realtime online multiplayer drinking game. sounded like a great idea when i still played drinking games, but turns out drinking and coding don't go well for me. i'm still proud of what i accomplished with it. the project mainly died due to me getting caught up on keeping track of user presence, and how to handle connection drops and the like. netcode stuff.

unfortunately the web has evolved again now and broken the app's online component.

the app was a PWA, used firebase for everything. designed for mobile viewing.
