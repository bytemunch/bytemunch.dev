Been a long time since my last devlog, whoopsie. Let's see if I can remember how to write.

## Beginning Again

I've moved all the progress made so far into a [prototype repo](https://github.com/bytemunch/dodgey-ball-prototype) and started a fresh codebase. Once I started trying to add multiplayer logic I realised that so many changes would need to be made that starting fresh would be less effort.

I tried to keep working on the project with the browser as the target platform, keeping the app in TypeScript, but I ran out of steam researching all the tech I'd need to use to make that happen. The project died, until recently where it is reborn as a Bevy game, with proper 3D workflows.

Here's to [the future](/blog/tags/temp-new-dodgeball-game-name)!
