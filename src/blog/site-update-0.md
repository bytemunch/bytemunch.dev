## KISS to the max

I've made plenty of websites in my time. All of which have been AJAX/SPA and heavily dependant on Javascript. All of which have been slow to first paint. This time I've gone for something different: the new old way, using eleventy and hosting a static site. Keeping everything as simple as possible should be great for accessibility, SEO and maintenance, and should be easy to keep looking clean.

## Easy Blogging

Writing devlogs and blog posts with my old site had a fair amount of friction, tagging and linking posts, keeping a flatfile database for timestamps, custom scripts to invoke markdown-it... Eleventy handles all of this effortlessly. With front matter tagging and dating, automatic tag page generation, pagination, and more, writing a new post is as simple as spewing thoughts into a file and saving. Hopefully this leads to more blogs, which spur me on to more code!

## What's next?

Now I've got a half-decent site up, work on [as yet untitled dodgeball game](/projects/untitled_dodgeball_game/) can continue in earnest. I hope to post a devlog once a week, but there'll be more or less depending on how busy my life is at the time.

The site still needs some accessibility work doing, and I could tweak my CSS forever... But I need to get better at reaching and recognising a finished state. So it'll do for now.
